My name is Pierce Bartine. I'm a programmer working in Austin, Texas for Clear Measure. My goal is to become [pretty good][1] at whatever currently has my attention. There are so many disparate bodies of knowledge out there that I can't help but want to [connect them][2]! Really, I just love learning, (mostly) regardless of the topic.

Outside of that, I'm also a swimmer (visualizing swimming data got me into programming). I like the water - pools, beaches, lakes - you name it. :ocean:
